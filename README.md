## **General info**

**Date**: July, 2020.  
**Duration**: 2 Days.

I started this litle project as a way to practice creating APIs with Java and Spring Boot Framework.


## **Demo**

You can try it using the [Demo](https://udsgit.github.io/covid-19), but I recommend that you first take a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/udsgit/covid-19/wiki/Wiki) to know all the functionalities.

## **Technologies**

- **Html**
- **Java**
- **Spring Boot**

## **Setup**

This project was not planned so you can continue it and more with the madness of having everything in one component, but if you want to try anyway, here are the steps...

1. Clone/Download the repository.

```console
git clone https://github.com/udsgit/covid-19.git
```

2. Move to the directory **src** and create a new file called **keys.json**.
3. Edit the previous file and add the following lines replacing **_YOUR KEY_** with your google chart api credential.

```yaml
{ "API_KEY": "YOUR KEY" }
```

4. You may have to install the packages with **NPM**.

```console
npm install
```

5. If you had an error, you will have to manually install some dependency.
6. And remember that to run the project, you will have to build it to generate the file **index.html**.

## **Usage**

1. Open the link from the [Demo](https://udsgit.github.io/random-teg) or open the file **index.html** if you followed the previous steps.
2. The first load maybe takes a few seconds to fetch the data from the API, so be patient üôÉ.
3. When everything is already loaded you can use it.
4. Finally, I recommend you look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/udsgit/covid-19/wiki/Wiki) that I have created that explains each sections for what it is for and how it works, even with screenshots üëç.

## **Status**

Project is: **_Completed._**

Because I have managed to do what I wanted, but it is likely that from time to time I will make a commit adding or correcting things.
